==== INTERACTIVE FORM PROJECT====
Submitted By: Kendra Roberson

GOAL:  I am shooting for an Exceeds expecations with this project.

OBJECTIVE:  To create a form that is user-friendly and which provides error messages or prompts regarding what information is needed along as they complete their registration form. If any 'Required' information is missing, the user will be prompted and the form will not submit. Overpayment for activities is prevented by deactivating activities that share the same date and time. Freedom of styling is permitted that does not affect the general structure of the form.

EXPERIENCE: This project was both exciting and challenging at the same time. Some home emergencies threw me off but I worked at it until I was happy with the final product.

"THANKS" to those reviewing this project!
